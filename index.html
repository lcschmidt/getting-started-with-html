<!-- Coments help PEOPLE read code. They are ignored by the computer. You should use comments to leave notes for yourself (and anyone else who might read your code later). -->

  <!-- The <title> element normally sets the name of the browser tab (but in this example codepen's title overrides the title I set) -->

<b> The Basics of the Web and HTML.</b>
<p> The major pieces of the web are:<br>
  1. your browser - which displays files found on the web, <br>
  2. the Internet - the world's largest computer network, <br>
  3. HTTP - the main protocol of the web, and <br>
  4. servers - computers that host the files that make up the web.
</p>
<p> HTML (hypertext markup language) is made up of: <br>
+ text content (what you see) <br>
+ mark up (what it looks like) <br>
+ references to other documents (eg images & videos)<br>
+ links to other pages
</p>
<p>HTML mark up is a way to change how the content of the website looks.  
  An <b>HTML element</b> consists of opening tags and closing tags around contents 
(like text). One example of mark up is making text bold, like the title above.
To do this, you type < b > text < /b > .<br>
</p>

  <p>HTML elements can have <b>attributes</b> which provide additional information
about the element.  For example, the anchor tag is used for making links. If I want to 
  include a link to the Udacity website by allowing you to click on the word <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> in 
  this sentence, I write < a href = "www.udacity.com" > Udacity < /a >.
</p>
<b> Coding and Computers</b><br>
    <p>Computers are <em>stupid</em>! This means they can't think for themselves so programmers
  to write code to tell them what to do in the way they can understand.  HTML is 
  a language to tell the computer how to display the content in a website.
